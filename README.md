## Idea 
Our idea revolves around predicting and managing flood disasters in India.

#### Our idea can be divided into 3 main parts:

#### 1) Pre-Disaster: 
  1. Using time-series data to study life-cycles of the natural phenomenon (Meteorlogical numerical, social-media texts, news reports, or/and satellite images) 
  2. Once main characteristics are extracted, we can suggest early warnings if a similar life-cycle is detected in areas. 
  3. Using social-media text data, studying the peaks in certain sentiments, we can give a generic warning.
  4. Using satellite imagery, we can study the pre-onset developments that take place, and suggest areas that will get the least affected and ares of maximum impact, based on latitutde-longitude.
  5. Using meterological data, we can study the behaviour of certain parameters that result in the calamity, thus warning local stations to alert their local areas to prepare better.

#### 2) During-Disaster: 
  1. Using the extracted life-cycles of previous disaster, their onset, their duration and how they receeded and the casualties and post-disaster effects, we can now predict the best solutions for the current disaster, and thus help in better targeting of relief funds.  
  2. As Connectivity is a big issue during such disasters, we can deploy network boosters using quadcopters.
  3. The quadcopters can also use thermal imaging to locate stranded survivors.
  4. Since network availabilty is an issue, we suggest using FM/AM radio network instead, which are built into any smart-phone or electronic device, and can be used for 2-way communication even in long-ranges. Survivors can broadcast to a local tower and ping themselves, or be relocated to the nearest shelter.
  5. Locating stranded survivors can be enhanced by detecting relief-requests from social-media text data, where family members or friends, report missing persons in the affected areas.
  6. Using satellite imagery/Google Maps, we can generate optimal routes so that relief-groups can deliver help to areas more faster.
  
#### 3) Post-Disaster:
  1. Using post-disaster meterological data and life-cycle history, we can suggest the most probable diseases that will spread and how they can be tackled.
  2. Using social-media we can suggest what sort of relief help was expected during(food, clean water, sanitary products, batteries, etc)  and after(cleaning products, clothes,etc ) the disaster, based on previous experiences. 


We plan on getting our data as:
> meterological data from Indian Meterological Department
> Social media text from Twitter,Facebook APIs and Google analytics for word-clouds
> Satellite imagery from NASA lat-long public datasets, etc. 

We plan on implementing the idea using image segmentation and feature learing, text mining and swarm clustering data models to use all the data-formats, so that we get more concrete conclusions and predictions.
